                        My journey with programming started on my own initiativeâ€”although I learned the basics during my studies (Teleinformatics), \
                        it was while working on my engineering project that I discovered my passion for web development. \
                        Building web applications came naturally to me, so I decided to deepen my knowledge through courses and personal projects. \
                        I gained the most experience during my internship, where I worked on real tasks, solved problems, and learned professional workflows. \
                        I had the opportunity to collaborate with various departments, such as design, backend, and marketing, which taught me effective communication and teamwork. \
                        Outside of programming, I'm passionate about sports and traveling.";
